# Image Color Palette Extractor

A Python program that extracts the dominant colors from an image and creates a visually appealing color palette. It uses OpenCV to load the image and Scikit-learnâ€™s KMeans clustering algorithm to identify the main colors. This project is an excellent way to learn about image analysis, clustering techniques, and visualization while producing engaging results.

## Features

- **Dominant Color Extraction**: Uses KMeans clustering to find the most common colors in the image.
- **Image Processing with OpenCV**: Utilizes OpenCV for efficient image loading and manipulation.
- **Color Palette Visualization**: Displays the extracted colors as a palette using Matplotlib.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- Numpy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib

Install the required libraries with:
```bash
pip install opencv-python numpy scikit-learn matplotlib
```

## Installation

1. Clone this repository or download the project files:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/username/image-color-palette-extractor.git
    cd image-color-palette-extractor
    ```

2. Ensure you have Python 3 installed:

    ```bash
    python --version
    ```

3. Install the required libraries:

    ```bash
    pip install opencv-python numpy scikit-learn matplotlib
    ```

4. Place your image file (e.g., `image.png`) in the project directory.

## Usage

1. Run the color palette extractor script:

    ```bash
    python color_palette_extractor.py
    ```

2. The program will read the specified image file (`image.png`) and extract the dominant colors.
3. A color palette will be displayed in a Matplotlib window showing the extracted colors.

## Example Workflow

1. Place an image file (e.g., `image.png`) in the project folder.
2. Run the script to generate and display the color palette.
3. Observe the extracted color palette, which showcases the dominant colors in the image.

## Professional Use Cases

This tool has several potential applications in the professional world:

1. **Design and Branding**: Extracting dominant colors from an image can help designers create cohesive color palettes for branding, websites, and marketing materials.
2. **Data Analysis in Fashion and Retail**: Retail companies can analyze product images to determine popular colors and trends, assisting in inventory decisions and targeted marketing strategies.
3. **Digital Art and Photography**: Photographers and digital artists can use the extracted color palette as inspiration for editing and color grading, ensuring visually consistent results.
4. **Content Creation and Social Media**: Content creators can extract a color palette from their photos to maintain a consistent visual theme across their social media posts.
